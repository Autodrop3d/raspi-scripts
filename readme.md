# Raspberry Pi Wlan/AP Mode Switching Scripts

#### What's all this then?
Well, as the title here says, these scripts enable a Paspberry Pi to switch between station mode (connect to an access point) and Access Point mode (it **_is_** an access point) without needing to reboot the Pi.

#### Ok... Why would I want that?
Well let's say that you want to have a Pi embedded in a thing that has no interface for a user to configure it. You could have a button connected to the Pi that triggers it to switch to AP mode. Then the user can to it with their smartphone or whatever and browse to a webserver hosted by the Pi. Or maybe you just want to be able to demo some network functionality when you're not in range of an access point.

#### Neat. So how do I make it work then?
Run this script as root. Use the -h flag to see usage info.

`./setup_wlan_and_AP_modes.sh -s <station mode SSID> -p <station mode password> -a <AP mode SSID> -r <AP mode password>`

By default, the Pi will boot into station mode. You can change this by including the -d flag when running this script. 

After running this script, you should reboot your Pi.

#### Then...
You can run the `switchToAP.sh` or `switchToWlan.sh` scripts (as root) to do what they say.

#### What if I want to change the station mode AP and passwords later?!
Just rerun the `setup_wlan_and_AP_modes.sh script with whatever you need!
